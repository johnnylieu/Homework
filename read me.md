# Refactoring Homework by Johnny Lieu

In this activity, I am taking an existing html & CSS file from UCSD Coding Bootcamp's respository and refactoring it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.

## Installation

* Download my "Develop" folder in its entirety.
* Using GitBash, navigate to this folder on your desktop.
* Use command "code .." in GitBash without the quatations.

## Usage

* This is strictly for educational purposes.

## History

At first, I was going to create a section in this read me file for changes I made to the refactoring homework but I figured this link would be better.
